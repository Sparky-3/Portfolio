        <h1>Lucy Day</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Lucy Day. I am currently a junior at Arlington Tech. 
            I own two cats and one dog. I love archery, computer science, and engineering!</p>
        
        <h2>Competitions</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite aspects of archery are the competitions.
         Chances to show your skills and hang out with cool people! The medals are always nice as well!</p>
