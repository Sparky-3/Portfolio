<h1><b>Lucy's Portfolio</b></h1>
<h2>What is Lucy's Portfolio?</h2>
<p>Lucy's Portfolio is a project in which I attempted to turn <a href='https://www.canva.com/design/DAGnzmDi4Eo/TaAZmIYEszuSK4gYZu8ppQ/edit?utm_content=DAGnzmDi4Eo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton'>this slideshow</a> into a real website using html and CSS.<p>
<h2>What did I learn in this project?</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to connect a html and css file.</li>
<li>How to change background and font color.</li>
<li>How to add, but not play, videos in html.</li>
<li>How to create and use grid.</li>
<li>How to crop and resize photos in css.</li>
<li>How to save large images in github.</li>
<li>How to use inspect to learn about grids.</li>
<li>How to create a project in VS and upload it to git.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What problems did I encounter?</h2>
<p>The first problem I encountered was creating a new project in VS and sending it properly to git. I had never used VS before this and had some problems getting the repository cloned correctly but I figured it out. Then I had issues storing my video files because they were too large for git, but Chris helped me us LFS to upload them. Then I had problems getting my grids to the correct size, but figured it out. Finally, I was working on getting the image to the correct size, but ran out of time to finish sizing it.</p>
<h2>How far did I get?</h2>
<p>I managed to get all images and videos showing in the html and started work on correctly sizing them. I also got the colors correct and got the text displaying.<p>
<h2>Hopes for the future</h2>
<p>In the future I plan to continue working on this project because I would really like to have my own website on lucyday.com (or whatever domain is avalible) to display my projects. I think it would help me with future employment prospects.</p> :)
